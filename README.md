## Description

Social-Connections is a backend `node.js` server side application. This backend application allows user to create a username using an email and username. the user can post their thoughts, react to thoughts and add/remove friends from a friendlist. The application uses `express.js` for routing, `MongoDB` as the database, `Mongoose ODM`, as well as `dayjs` to format the date and time for thoughts and reactions. `Insomnia` is used to test API routes for `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`.
